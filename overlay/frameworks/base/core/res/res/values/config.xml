    <!-- The list of IMEs which should be disabled until used.
         This function suppresses update notifications for these pre-installed apps.
         We need to set this configuration carefully that they should not have functionarities
         other than "IME" or "Spell Checker". In InputMethodManagerService,
         the listed IMEs are disabled until used when all of the following conditions are met.
         1. Not selected as an enabled IME in the Settings
         2. Not selected as a spell checker in the Settings
         3. Installed
         4. A pre-installed IME
         5. Not enabled
         And the disabled_until_used state for an IME is released by InputMethodManagerService
         when the IME is selected as an enabled IME. -->
